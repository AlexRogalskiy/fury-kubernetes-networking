# Networking Core Module version v1.6.0

Welcome to a new update of the Fury Networking core module.
This time, we add Kubernetes 1.20 support while deprecating the support to Kubernetes 1.17.
The release also includes a minor upgrade of the Calico deployment, from 3.17 to 3.19.

## Changelog

- Upgrade [calico](../../katalog/calico) CNI. From 3.17.1 to 3.19.1.
- Kubernetes support:
  - Deprecate Kubernetes 1.17 support.
  - Kubernetes 1.20 is considered stable.
  - Kubernetes 1.21 is considered tech preview.

## Upgrade path

To upgrade this core module from `v1.5.1` to `v1.6.0`, you need to download this new version, then apply the
`kustomize` project. No further action is required.

```bash
kustomize build katalog/ip-masq | kubectl apply -f -
kustomize build katalog/calico | kubectl apply -f -
```

### Important note

The upgrade takes some minutes *(depends on the cluster size)*,
and you should expect some downtime during the upgrade process.
